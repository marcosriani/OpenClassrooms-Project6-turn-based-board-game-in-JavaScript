# OpenClassrooms - Project6 Turn based board game in JavaScript
Build a turn-based board game in JavaScript


Create an online game written JavaScript in which 2 players play each turn to compete


Step 1: Generate the map
Start by randomly generating the game map. Each box can be either:

Empty
Unavailable (dimmed)

The placement of the two players is also randomly on the map


Step 2: Movements
For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn


Step 3: Fight!

If players cross over adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically), a battle begins.
Each player attacks in turn
The damage depends on the player's weapon
